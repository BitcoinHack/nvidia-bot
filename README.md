## Installation

This project uses [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) to manage dependencies. Hop in my [Discord](https://discord.gg/hQeUbRv) if you have ideas, need help or just want to tell me about how you got your new 3080.

```
pip install pipenv
pipenv shell 
pipenv install
```

Run it
```
python app.py

Usage: app.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  amazon
  nvidia
```

## Usage

Ok now we have a basic GUI. GUIs aren't my strong suit, but pretty much the top box is the settings for amazon and
the bottom box is the settings for Nvidia. 

### Amazon 
- Open a chrome browser
- Log into Amazon
- Go to a product page
- Refresh the page until the 'Buy Now' option exists
- If the price is under the "Price Limit", it will buy the item.

Example usage:
```
python app.py amazon
Amazon Email []: hari@email.com
Amazon Password []: mypassword
Amazon Item URL []: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HHDP9DW
Maximum Price to Pay [1000]: 1000

INFO: "2020-09-19 00:07:06,474 - Initial availability message is: Currently unavailable. We don't know when or if this item will be back in stock.
INFO: "2020-09-19 00:07:06,494 - Refreshing page.
INFO: "2020-09-19 00:07:07,695 - Current availability message is: Currently unavailable. We don't know when or if this item will be back in stock.
```

### Nvidia 
- Call Digitalriver API to get product number for the GPU selected (2060S, 3080, 3090)
- Call Digitalriver API to check if the GPU is in stock until it is in stock
- Will open a window in your default browser with the GPU in your cart when it is stock.

Example usage:
```
python app.py nvidia
What GPU are you after?: 3080
What locale shall we use? [en_us]:

```

### Notifications
This uses a notifications handler that will support multiple notification channels. 

#### Twilio
To enable Twilio notifications, first go to https://www.twilio.com/ and create a free account and get a Twilio number.
Then make a copy of twilio_config.template_json and name it twilio_config.json. If this file exists and the credentials are
valid, the notification handler will send you an sms when it carts or purchases an item.
```
{
  "account_sid": "ACCOUNT_SID",
  "auth_token": "AUTH_TOKEN",
  "from": "YOUR TWILIO NUMBER",
  "to": "THE NUMBER YOU WANT TO SEND SMS TO"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

I suggest joining the #Support channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/hQeUbRv) for personal assistance if these common fixes don't help.

**Error: ```selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: unknown error: cannot find Chrome binary```** 
The issue is that chrome is not installed in the expected location. See [Selenium Wiki](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver#requirements) and the section on [overriding the Chrome binary location .](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/capabilities#TOC-Using-a-Chrome-executable-in-a-non-standard-location)

The easy fix for this is to add an option where selenium is used (amazon.py)
```
chrome_options.binary_location="C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"
```

**Error: ```selenium.common.exceptions.SessionNotCreatedException: Message: session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 85```**

You are not running the proper version of Chrome this requires. As of this update, the current version is Chrome 85. Check your version by going to ```chrome://version/``` in your browser. We are going to be targeting the current stable build of chrome. If you are behind, please update, if you are on a beta or canary branch, you'll have to build your own version of chromedriver-py.
